# Mobile-Computer-Vision (MCV)
App Builders Mobile Computer Vision abstraction, for Android &amp; iOs

This project's actually a beta, it has a lot of issues, please read all the documentation before implementing into your projects.

For the moment we only support Android platform, in the future we gonna release the iOS version, be patient.

This library has 100% base in Google Mobile Vision API, over this, we construct a strong repertory of methods and interfaces to make easy the work.

The scope of this library it's create easiest OCR Readers, CodaBar &amp; QR Scanners and face recognitions with faster implementation.

### Our architecture:

#### FaceRecognition

#### CodeScanner

## Android Setup

It's highly recommended in your manifest activate "accelerate hardware", 'cause if it's possible to use de GPU to help the CPU, the process gonna be faster.
